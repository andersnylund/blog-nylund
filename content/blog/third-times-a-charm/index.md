title: Third time's a charm

For some time I've wanted to create my own personal site and a blog associated with it. I've tried multiple different technologies and platforms to achieve this. I wanted to do this so that I could learn web technologies and additionally could express myself. Wrote about that in my first post [here](https://blog.andersnylund.com/hello).

The first time I tried to create a personal blog I used [KeystoneJS](https://keystonejs.com/) that I were running on an AWS EC2 instance. It was running for some time, but as it was basically my first touch with web development it failed and there were too many hurdles on the way. The development stalled and at some point a deleted it.

After some time I got excited and tried again. This time I investigated more and found a framework called [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). It seemed simple and the premade templates were suitable for my purpose. I wanted to make my own design on top of it, but that would be a continuous process. The hosting was done by Amazon S3 buckets, what I found quite easy to set up. There was some problems with setting up the domain, but after some time I got it working. I wrote a couple of posts there, but I was not happy with the design of the blog at all.

So... 3rd time's a charm. I've been picking up React during the summer and getting quite comfortable with it. I wanted to utilize my knowledge and further develop my skills and therefore chose to go with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). This time hosting is done by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and I have to say that Netlify is so awesome! The setup is SO easy and deploying standard node applications is no problem at all.

This time the setup is permanent. I've set up https://blog.andersnylund.com for blogging and https://www.andersnylund.com for my portfolio.
