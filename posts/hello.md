This site has been up for a while now just waiting for something to happen. Finally I got myself to write something here. Actually this is the 2nd blog I've created, but the first one had some problems so I took it down. To the point, starting a blog has for a long time been a dream of mine. Expressing myself has always been difficult for me and I think that this blog will help me to get better at it. Reflecting and writing down things I have learned or find interesting helps in the learning process and allows me to reflect back on myself and my learning.

This blog is going to be tech oriented as that is my big passion. However, it will not be limited to that and posts will have topics about everything around technology. I work as a software developer and study software engineering and I'm really interested about the social or soft parts of development work and how that affects and relates to what actually gets created. Therefore I hope that all kinds of readers can get something out from my experiences and thoughts that I jot down here.

That's all I had for this short intro. More is on the way!
