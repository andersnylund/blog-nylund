JAMStack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) is a new buzzword in the web-world, and I am trying to de-mystify it. So, I created [a blog](https://www.alicevidjeskog.com) that utilizes this stack! üî• The end result is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), that is connected to [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io). Sanity hosts the CMS and a studio to edit the content.

Sanity is a headless CMS service. They have a free developer tier that has more than enough capabilities for playing around and testing out the service. Sanity also allows hosting of the backend and a content studio for editing the content. Sanity features management of multiple databases so you could have 2 different environments for a blog e.g. one for local development and testing and another one for production. Because the studio has a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, there is not need to write markup. Therefore this stack is not quite JAMStack üòè

I have to say that setting everything up and running was very easy. I followed [this](https://www.sanity.io/blog/how-to-quickly-set-up-a-gatsby-js-jamstack-website-with-a-headless-cms) tutorial from Sanity. The tutorial explains each step in detail and I had no problems in getting everything up and running. The result of the tutorial is a basic template with minimal styling. However, I thought that it was good enough for now, and I've only added some minor animations and a big hero picture on the landing page.

The styling of the blogsite is still in the early stages, and I do not like the starter's way of styling. I will probably at some point rewrite the styling with CSS-in-JS utilizing styled-components.

When first played around with the setup, I sometimes wondered why the content wasn't updated on the deployed version on Netlify, but then I remembered that Gatsby is a static site generator, and not a dynamic React application. The gatsby site requires a re-build so that the content is updated. Sanity's tutorial instructs on setting up a hook from Netlify to Sanity. After doing that, each update in the sanity studio (be it on your own computer via the development studio, or via the sanitys-deployed studio), Netlify will trigger a new build that finishes in under a minute. AWESOME! üí™üèª
